Image Store (ImStore) is a Image Gallery and Store plugin for WordPress with a slideshow option. This 
plugin was created because I saw the need of the worpress community to have a images store that didn't required the installation of multiple
plugins to get this accomplished or to go through a lot of settings. :@)

The plugin fully integrated with the wordpress database the only thing that is created is a post_expire column on the posts table.
so you will not find extra tables on your database ( Cool!.. at least for me I hate extra tables ).
