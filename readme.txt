Image Store (ImStore) is a photo gallery and store plugin for WordPress with Paypal and Google Checkout integration.

== Description ==
This plugin was created because there was a need in the WordPress community to have an images store that did not required the installation of multiple plugins. Enjoy!! and please support the plugin. :@) 

The plugin fully integrated with the WordPress database, so you will not find any extra tables on your database (Cool!.. at least for me, I hate extra tables). NextGEN Gallery alternative.
